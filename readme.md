**Hello**
=======
*How I suffered when writing this file in Vim*
------

And the devil pulled me to ask Herman what to write "readme.md". Having received an answer like " Yes, it's all the same, but it's better in Vim.....". I went on a search through the Internet. After shoveling a bunch of videos and articles, I sat down to write this creation.

*Special thanks*
